    <p>The ones who are fond of the roads will surely enjoy driving on the Ghat road that leads to Maredumilli. This is one of the most underexplored hill stations in Andhra Pradesh. During monsoons, this place becomes all the more magical! You can take shelter under traditional huts, enjoy a cup of elaichi chai or feast on the region’s famous – Bamboo biryani! The meat along with the biryani rice and flavours will be stuffed into a bamboo and steamed under high flame. The flavours are rich and juicy, prompting you to order one more round of this lip-smacking delicacy. There are impressive waterfalls, viewpoints and parks around the hill station that you can explore. The freshwater streams are so pure that you can directly drink from them! The locals do it all the time. There is minimal pollution, less noise and stunning views are almost everywhere. For couples, this will prove to be the most romantic getaway and you can definitely have your ‘Tum Se Hi’ moment under the pouring sky!  For the ones who don’t like rains, you can always visit Maredumilli during the winter months when the maximum temperature rarely crosses 25 degrees Celsius. </p>
