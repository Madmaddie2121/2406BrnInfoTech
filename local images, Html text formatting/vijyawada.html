     <p>Kanaka Durga Temple, officially known as Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Kanaka Durga. The deity in this temple is also popularly referred as Kanaka Durga. The temple is located in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India on the Indrakeeladri hill on the banks of Krishna River.[1] Kaalika Purana, Durgaa Sapthashati and other Vedic literature have mentioned about Kanaka Durga on the Indrakeelaadri and have described the deity as Swayambhu, (self-manifested) in Triteeya Kalpa.

        The popular legend is about the triumph of Kanaka Durga over the demon King Mahishasura. It is said that the growing menace of demons became unbearable for the natives. Sage Indrakila practiced severe penance, and when the goddess appeared the sage pleaded to her to reside on his head and keep a vigil on the wicked demons. As per his wishes of killing the demons, Durga made Indrakila her permanent abode. Later, she also slayed the demon king Mahishasura freeing the people of Vijayawada from evil.[2]

At the Kanaka Durga temple, the enchanting 4-foot-high (1.2 m) icon of the deity is bedecked in glittering ornaments and bright flowers. Her icon here depicts her eight-armed form, each holding a powerful weapon, in a standing posture over the demon Mahishashura and piercing him with her trident. The goddess is the epitome of beauty.
