    <p>Papi Hills are also known as Papikondalu. It is one of the best hill stations in Andhra Pradesh that also holds great spiritual significance in Hinduism. People believe that Lord Ram and his wife Sita visited this place when they were exiled from their palace in Ayodhya. Papikondalu are magical and have the perfect scenery that is sure to tug at your heartstrings. The hills are shielded by translucent mist and the stream of the Godavari River passes through twists and turns between these towering beauties. You can either reach Kunavaram, Polavaram or Rajahmundry first to go to Papikondalu. These places are 50 km, 20 km, and 60 km away from the hill station respectively. You will have to take a 5-seater motorboat or a river streamer with the capacity to carry a maximum of 60 people. This is the only way to reach the spot. Bhadrachalam is a historic place that is discussed in the Ramayana epic. People usually plan a boat trip from Rajahmundry to Bhadrachalam which also covers the journey through Papi hills. Adventure seekers can also make camp and trek around the surroundings of these hills. </p>
