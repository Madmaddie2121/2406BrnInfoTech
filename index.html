        <h3>Police denies collection of private data, says password was weak</h3>
        <p>Telangana DGP Ravi Gupta also stated that the police’s Hawkeye mobile application only retains user information such as mobile numbers, addresses, and email IDs as part of its data repository. “Prima-facie, it is suspected that because of a weak / compromised password, the intruder might have obtained access to certain segments of Hawkeye data by generating a report,” he said in a release.<br>About the TSCOP app, the Telangana DGP said it is utilized for in-house tasks, “guaranteeing no collection of confidential/financial user data”. He also categorically denied Kodali’s statement that the police is collecting information of people checking into hotels. “It is a fact that TSCOP does not collect any Visitor / Hotel Management Data, at all. Hence, it is absolutely incorrect to say that TSCOP pushed / gave such Data to any third party. Therefore, certain related media reports that appeared in newspapers are denied,” he added.</p>
