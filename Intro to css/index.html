      Kanaka Durga Temple, officially known as Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla
      Devasthanam, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Kanaka Durga. The deity in
      this temple is also popularly referred as Kanaka Durga. The temple is
      located in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India on the Indrakeeladri hill on
      the banks of Krishna River.[1] Kaalika Purana, Durgaa Sapthashati and
      other Vedic literature have mentioned about Kanaka Durga on the
      Indrakeelaadri and have described the deity as Swayambhu,
      (self-manifested) in Triteeya Kalpa.<br />
      The popular legend is about the triumph of Kanaka Durga over the demon
      King Mahishasura. It is said that the growing menace of demons became
      unbearable for the natives. Sage Indrakila practiced severe penance, and
      when the goddess appeared the sage pleaded to her to reside on his head
      and keep a vigil on the wicked demons. As per his wishes of killing the
      demons, Durga made Indrakila her permanent abode. Later, she also slayed
      the demon king Mahishasura freeing the people of Vijayawada from evil.[2]
      At the Kanaka Durga temple, the enchanting 4-foot-high (1.2 m) icon of the
      deity is bedecked in glittering ornaments and bright flowers. Her icon
      here depicts her eight-armed form, each holding a powerful weapon, in a
      standing posture over the demon Mahishashura and piercing him with her
      trident. The goddess is the epitome of beauty.

      The Nallamalas (also called the Nallamalla Range) are a section of the
      Eastern Ghats which forms the eastern boundary of Rayalaseema region of
      the state of Andhra Pradesh and Nagarkurnool district of the state of
      Telangana, in India. They run in a nearly north–south alignment, parallel
      to the Coromandel Coast for close to 430 km between the rivers, Krishna
      and Pennar. Its northern boundaries are marked by the flat Palnadu basin
      while in the south it merges with the Tirupati hills. An extremely old
      system, the hills have extensively weathered and eroded over the years.
      The average elevation today is about 520 m which reaches 1100 m at
      Bhairani Konda and 1048 m at Gundla Brahmeswara.[1] Both of these peaks
      are in a north westerly direction from the town of Cumbum. There are also
      many other peaks above 800m
      <br />
      The rocks of the Nallamala ranges belong to the Kadapa system which is a
      series some 20,000 ft. thick.[3] The primary rocks are quartzite overlaid
      with an irregular slaty formation. Some sandstone is also to be found. The
      rocks here are very irregular and soft in texture thus rendering
      commercial exploitation impossible. These rocks are among the oldest in
      the world and have been formed as a result of large scale volcanic
      activity hundreds of millions of years ago. The evidence of the volcanic
      forces are evident in the foldings into which the rocks have been forced.

      <br />

      and Lakshmana on his return from Lankapuri.[15] As per the Purana, a loan
      of one crore and 11.4 million gold coins was sought by Balaji from Kubera
      for his marriage with Padmavathi. To pay back the loan, devotees from all
      over India visit the temple and donate money

      Yaganti Temple or Sri Yaganti Uma Maheswara Temple is a temple of Shiva in
      Nandyal district in the India state of Andhra Pradesh. It was built
      according to Vaishnavaite traditions.
      <br />
      This temple was constructed by King Harihara Bukka Raya of the Sangama
      Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century.[citation needed]
      It was built according to Vaishnavaite traditions. One story of the site's
      origin is as follows: The sage Agastya wanted to build a temple for Lord
      Venkateswara on this site. However, the statue that was made could not be
      installed as the toe nail of the idol got broken. The sage was upset over
      this and performed a penance for Shiva. When Shiva appeared, he said the
      place suits Shiva better as it resembles Kailash. Agastya then requested
      Shiva to give the devotees a Parvathi Goddess as Lord Uma Maheswara in a
      single stone, which Shiva obliged. A second story is as follows:
      Chitteppa, a devotee of Shiva, was worshiping Shiva and Shiva appeared to
      him as a tiger. Chitteppa understood that it was Lord Shiva in tiger form,
      and shouted Neganti Shivanu ne kanti (meaning: I saw Shiva I saw), and
      danced with joy. There is a cave called Chitteppa nearby. Sri Yaganti Uma
      Maheswara Temple is one of the few temples patronized by one of the great
      dynasties of India. Every year Maha Shivaratri is celebrated and a large
      number of devotees from all over Andhra Pradesh visit. Shiva, Parvati and
      Nandi are the main deities in this temple. This temple is 14 km away from
      Banaganipalli in kurnool dt. The saint lord Veerabrahmendra swami stayed
      here for some time and wrote Kalagnanam
